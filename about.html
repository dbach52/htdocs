        <h2>about</h2>

        <p>
        I'm a Western New Yorker who's been in the Midwest for a dozen years now (so does that make me a Midwesterner now? Ope maybe.) 
        <p>
        I went to Indiana Wesleyan University for college where I studied communication, which, as with any field that doesn't involve becoming a lawyer or a doctor, means you get asked "What are you going to do with that?" over and over again. 
        <p>
        Since leaving IWU, I have made a career in the public sector by working with Indiana Homeland Security, the federal government, the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, and the Ohio Auditor of State. 
        <p>
        For fun, I have <a href="https://adroadtrip2017.wordpress.com/">bicycled across America</a>, gone on <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/191971670@N04/51739911834/in/album-72157720240299422">safari in Tanzania</a>, and taken up photography as a pastime.

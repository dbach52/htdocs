    <h3>About</h3>
    
    <main>
      <p>I graduated from Indiana Wesleyan University in 2014 with a degree in communication and political science. After graduation, I was selected as an Indiana Governor’s Fellow. Throughout the yearlong fellowship, I worked for the Indiana Department of Homeland Security, the Indiana Economic Development Corporation, and the Office of the Governor during the 2015 legislative session.</p>

<p>After completing the fellowship program, I took a full-time position with the Indiana Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Public Affairs in June 2015, where I served as a public information specialist.</p>

<p>In June 2017, I left IDHS to bike across the U.S.A. with a friend — a journey I documented on Instagram @dcrbach and on a blog.</p>

<p>From November 2017 to April 2019, I worked on contracts for J&M Global Solutions as an economic recovery analyst with the federal government in Texas and the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>

<p>Since April 2019, I have worked as a public information officer with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources focusing on internal and external communications, photography, and videography.</p>

    <h3>2023: A Trip Out West</h3>
    <main>
        <p>In March, I took a trip out west with my good friends Anthony and Darcie. I flew in to Salt Lake City, Utah, where Anthony picked me up and we drove down to Arizona, through New Mexico, Texas, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky and back to Ohio.</p> 
        <p>I took a ton of pictures along the way with my trusty Nikon, a few of which are posted below.</p>
        <p>The West is simply astounding in its size and grandeur. As a lifelong resident east of the Mississippi, there's nothing quite like it where I'm from.</p>
